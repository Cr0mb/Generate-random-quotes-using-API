# Quote Generator

This Python script fetches a random quote from Quotable, an open API for quotes.

## How it works
- The script makes an HTTP GET request to https://api.quotable.io/random to fetch a random quote.
- If the request is successful (status code 200), it prints the quote to the console.
- If there's an error or the request fails, it prints a failure message.
